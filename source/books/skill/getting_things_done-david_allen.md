## 🧠 Overview

*Getting Things Done (GTD)* presents a **comprehensive system for managing personal and professional tasks** in a way that **reduces stress, increases clarity**, and **boosts productivity**. David Allen's method is based on the principle that **your mind is for having ideas, not holding them**.

By breaking down goals and responsibilities into actionable items stored in a trusted system, GTD enables you to work with a **clear head** and a **focused mind**, even in chaotic environments.

## 🔬 Main Science (Relation with Scientific Theories)

GTD aligns with **cognitive load theory** and **executive function research**, emphasizing that the brain has **limited capacity for holding open loops** (unfinished tasks). The system functions as an **external brain**, freeing working memory and allowing for better **focus and decision-making**.

- 🧠 **Working Memory**: GTD reduces overload by encouraging offloading mental tasks into a physical or digital system.
- 🔄 **Contextual Triggers**: By organizing actions by context (e.g., @phone, @computer), GTD mimics how our brain uses environmental cues to activate goals.
- 🗂️ **Chunking & Hierarchies**: Projects vs. next actions mirror how we process information in hierarchies for easier recall and action.

## 🧨 Criticism

- ❗**Too complex for some users**: While comprehensive, some find the system overwhelming to implement fully.
- 🌀 **Overemphasis on organization**: Critics say GTD risks prioritizing management over action.
- 🔁 **Maintenance-heavy**: Weekly reviews, inbox zero, and regular sorting require discipline and time.
- 🤖 **Lack of emotional dimension**: GTD doesn’t address the emotional resistance to tasks (e.g., procrastination, fear, perfectionism).

## 🛠️ Practical Takeaways

### ✅ The GTD Core Workflow (5 Steps)

1. **Capture** – Collect all the “stuff” that’s on your mind into an inbox.
2. **Clarify** – Decide what each item means and what to do about it.
3. **Organize** – Place reminders and materials in appropriate places.
4. **Reflect** – Review regularly (especially the Weekly Review).
5. **Engage** – Use context and energy level to pick what to do now.

### 🗂️ Actionable Categories

- **Projects**: Any outcome requiring more than one action.
- **Waiting For**: Things delegated or pending.
- **Someday/Maybe**: Not actionable now but of interest.
- **Calendar**: Time-specific actions.
- **Reference**: Non-actionable information.
