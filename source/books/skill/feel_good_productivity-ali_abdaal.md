<!-- # Book Review: *Feel Good Productivity* by Ali Abdaal -->

## Overview

In *Feel Good Productivity*, Ali Abdaal, a former doctor turned productivity expert and popular YouTuber, challenges traditional productivity approaches that emphasize discipline and relentless hustle. Instead, Abdaal argues that positive emotions such as joy, curiosity, and connection are the true drivers of sustainable productivity. Supported by psychological research and neuroscience, the book provides a framework to help readers become productive by feeling good.

## Core Concepts

The book is structured around three main pillars:

### 1. Energize

Abdaal emphasizes the importance of energy management through his "Three Ps":

- **Play**: Injecting fun and curiosity into daily tasks to boost engagement.
- **Power**: Building self-efficacy and autonomy to enhance confidence.
- **People**: Utilizing social connections for motivation and accountability.

Abdaal recommends practical exercises such as reframing tasks by asking, "What would this look like if it were fun?"

### 2. Unblock

To address procrastination, Abdaal outlines three primary barriers and how to overcome them:

- **Clarity**: Clearly define goals and next steps.
- **Courage**: Recognize and reframe fears related to tasks.
- **Getting Started**: Minimize friction by breaking tasks into simpler, manageable actions.

Practical tools like the "5-minute rule" help readers start tasks effortlessly, building momentum for sustained action.

### 3. Sustain

Abdaal tackles burnout prevention, identifying common causes such as:

- **Overexertion**: Taking on excessive workloads without proper rest.
- **Depletion**: Failing to recharge and restore personal energy.
- **Misalignment**: Working on tasks misaligned with personal values and goals.

He advocates for deliberate scheduling of breaks, alignment of work with personal values, and the practice of self-compassion.
