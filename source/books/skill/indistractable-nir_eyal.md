## 🧭 Overview

*Indistractable* is a modern guide to mastering attention in a world full of digital noise, internal urges, and relentless distractions. Nir Eyal presents a four-part model for becoming "indistractable"—a state where you deliberately align your actions with your intentions. Rather than simply blaming technology or external triggers, the book dives deeper into **why we get distracted in the first place**, focusing on **internal triggers** like discomfort, boredom, or anxiety.

Eyal blends behavioral psychology, neuroscience, and practical life strategies to help readers reclaim control over their time and attention—at work, in relationships, and even in parenting.

## 🧠 Main Science Behind the Book

The core psychological insights come from:

- **Behavioral conditioning** (B.F. Skinner): Variable rewards, especially in tech apps, keep us hooked.
- **Motivational theory**: We’re not distracted by tech itself, but by our **desire to escape discomfort**.
- **Cognitive dissonance** and **self-determination theory**: Inner conflict arises when we act against our values, leading to dissatisfaction and more distraction.
- **Precommitment techniques**: Using tools like “effort pacts” and “price pacts” leverages the power of commitment and loss aversion.

Eyal frames distraction as the **inability to manage discomfort**—not a time management issue, but an emotional one.

## ⚖️ Criticism

- **Too behaviorally focused**: Some critics feel the book overemphasizes individual control and underplays the structural and systemic elements of distraction (e.g., manipulative tech design).
- **Repetitive structure**: While well-organized, certain concepts are reiterated frequently.
- **Solutions can feel overly simplistic**: Some readers find tools like “pacts” or “schedules” difficult to maintain long-term without deeper emotional work.

## ✅ Practical Takeaways

### 🔄 Understand the Trigger Loop

1. **Internal trigger** (boredom, stress) →  
2. **Impulse** (grab your phone) →  
3. **Behavior** (scroll social media) →  
4. **Reward** (temporary relief)

Break the loop by recognizing the internal discomfort driving the behavior.

### 📅 Timebox Your Day

> “You can’t call something a distraction unless you know what it’s distracting you from.”

- Use **timeboxing** instead of a to-do list.
- Align your schedule with your values (work, health, relationships, play).
- Block time for both **traction** (value-aligned actions) and **reactive tasks**.

---

### 🔕 Hack External Triggers

- Turn off **non-critical notifications**.
- Keep devices **out of sight** during focus time.
- Use tools like “Do Not Disturb” or apps like Forest, Focusmate, and RescueTime.

---

### 🛡️ Make Precommitment Pacts

- **Effort Pact**: Add effort to make distractions harder (e.g., uninstall social apps).
- **Price Pact**: Add a financial penalty if you break focus (e.g., bet on Stickk).
- **Identity Pact**: Call yourself “Indistractable” — build it into your self-image.
