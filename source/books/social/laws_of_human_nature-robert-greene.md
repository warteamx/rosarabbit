> "If you can begin to see people as they are, not as you wish them to be, you will navigate this world far more effectively."

- **Nietzsche**: The will to power and overcoming herd morality
- **Erikson & Maslow**: Identity, purpose, and self-actualization
- **Behavioral Psychology**: Emotional triggers, mirroring, and reinforcement

## ⚖️ Criticism

1. **Dense & Long**: At over 600 pages, the book is not for casual readers. Each chapter is a self-contained treatise.
2. **Cynical Tone**: Some readers interpret Greene’s style as cold or manipulative, though he emphasizes awareness, not exploitation.
3. **Overgeneralizations**: Some “laws” could be seen as archetypal rather than universal; real people are more complex.
