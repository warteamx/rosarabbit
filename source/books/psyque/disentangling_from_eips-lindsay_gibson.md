## 🔬 Main Science (Relation with Psychological Theories)

Gibson’s work is informed by clinical psychology, attachment theory, and trauma-informed care. The book explores how emotionally immature people often exhibit traits of narcissism, avoidance, or controlling behavior. These dynamics can trap emotionally attuned individuals—often "internalizers"—into cycles of people-pleasing and self-abandonment.

Gibson outlines how understanding emotional maturity is essential for psychological boundaries and personal identity development. Her approach aligns with schema therapy, somatic psychology, and emotional regulation frameworks.
