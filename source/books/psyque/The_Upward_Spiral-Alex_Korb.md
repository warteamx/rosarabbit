## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways: Practical and Actionable Tips

- **Move Your Body**  
  Exercise boosts dopamine and serotonin levels‚Äîeven a short walk can help regulate brain chemistry.

- **Prioritize Sleep**  
  Improving sleep habits is one of the *most powerful* ways to break the cycle of depression. Stick to a consistent sleep schedule and reduce light exposure before bed.

- **Practice Gratitude**  
  Writing down three things you're grateful for daily can shift attention away from negativity and train the brain for positivity.

- **Make Decisions**  
  Even small decisions (what to eat, where to walk) strengthen the brain's decision-making centers, helping to reduce feelings of helplessness.

- **Reach Out for Connection**  
  Social connection‚Äîeven if brief or imperfect‚Äîstimulates the brain‚Äôs reward system. Texting a friend or saying hello to a neighbor counts.

- **Self-Compassion Is Essential**  
  Be gentle with yourself. Criticizing yourself for feeling bad only deepens the downward spiral.

- **Start Anywhere**  
  Because of how brain circuits work, improving **any** area‚Äîsleep, exercise, gratitude‚Äîcan lift the entire system upward.
