By illustrating the fluid, non-linear nature of grief, the authors provide empirical and anecdotal evidence to support the psychological concepts behind emotional processing and resilience. The text connects closely with theories of attachment, loss, and trauma, positioning grief as a universal yet deeply personal psychological experience.
