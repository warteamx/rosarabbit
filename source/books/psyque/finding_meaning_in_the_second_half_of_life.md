## 📝 Overview

In *Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life*, Jungian analyst James Hollis explores the deep psychological and spiritual work that often arises during midlife. He argues that the first half of life is typically spent meeting social expectations and constructing a persona that may not reflect our true selves.

As we enter the second half, life calls us to confront our inner conflicts, examine long-held patterns, and pursue individuation—the journey toward authenticity and wholeness. Rather than a crisis, Hollis frames midlife as a profound opportunity for transformation.
