## 📝 Overview (Summary)  
Gabor Maté, a physician and bestselling author, explores the intimate link between **chronic stress, emotional repression, and disease**. Drawing from clinical cases and neuroscience, Maté argues that many illnesses (cancer, autoimmune conditions, ALS, multiple sclerosis) are not random occurrences, but partly the result of a lifetime of **suppressing emotions, boundaries, and needs**.  

His central thesis: **The body will say “no” when the mind cannot.** Illness becomes the body’s final attempt to protect itself after years of psychological neglect and stress.

## 🔬 Main Science (Relation with Scientific Theories)  
- **Psychoneuroimmunology:** Stress impacts the immune system, making the body more vulnerable to disease.  
- **HPA Axis Dysfunction:** Chronic stress dysregulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, causing cortisol imbalances and inflammation.  
- **Attachment Theory:** Early childhood emotional neglect leads to coping mechanisms like people-pleasing, emotional repression, and self-sacrifice—factors strongly linked to chronic illness.  
- **Epigenetics:** Stress and trauma can alter gene expression, influencing susceptibility to disease.  

---

## ⚖️ Criticism  
- Some critics argue Maté may overemphasize psychological factors while underestimating genetics, environmental toxins, or random chance in disease onset.  
- His case studies, while compelling, are anecdotal rather than randomized controlled trials.  
- Still, his integrative approach is widely praised for **humanizing medicine** and encouraging emotional awareness as part of health.
