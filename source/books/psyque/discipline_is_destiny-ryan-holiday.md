## 🔬 Main Science (Relation with Philosophy and Psychology)

The foundation of *Discipline Is Destiny* is rooted in **Stoic philosophy**, particularly teachings from Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, and Seneca. It also draws on insights from:

- **Modern psychology:** Including delayed gratification (e.g., the Marshmallow Test), cognitive-behavioral principles, and habit formation.
- **Behavioral science:** Willpower as a finite resource (ego depletion), and how routines help reduce decision fatigue.
- **Philosophical virtue ethics:** Living a good life means living in accordance with reason, which requires self-mastery.

Holiday bridges ancient wisdom with modern life, making Stoicism both accessible and actionable.
