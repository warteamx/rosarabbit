## 📝 Overview

*Being Mortal* is a profoundly moving and deeply honest book by Atul Gawande—a practicing surgeon and gifted storyteller. It tackles one of life’s most universal, yet often unspoken realities: how we age and die. Gawande masterfully blends personal stories, medical insights, and cultural critiques to explore how modern medicine has often failed people in the final stages of life, not by doing too little—but by doing too much.

## 🌟 What Makes It Powerful

### 1. Personal and Professional Blend  

Gawande brings a rare dual lens: that of a doctor and that of a son. His narratives—ranging from patients facing terminal illnesses to his own father’s decline—make the book deeply relatable and emotionally grounding.

### 2. Questioning the Medical System  

He critiques the prevailing medical model that treats aging and dying as problems to be fixed, rather than natural processes to be supported.

### 3. Human Dignity at the Center  

The heart of the book is about autonomy and dignity. Often, it’s not living longer, but having control, comfort, connection, and meaning in the final days.
