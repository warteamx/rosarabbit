## 🖋️ Overview

*The Highly Sensitive Person* by psychologist Elaine N. Aron is a groundbreaking book that introduced the concept of HSPs to mainstream audiences. Aron's research-based and deeply empathetic guide offers validation and practical advice to the 15–20% of the population who process sensory and emotional stimuli more deeply than average. Rather than viewing sensitivity as a weakness, Aron reframes it as a powerful trait that—when properly understood and managed—can be a source of strength, creativity, and connection.

## 🔬 Main Science (Relation with Psychological Theories)

Aron’s work is rooted in biopsychology, personality theory, and developmental psychology. Drawing from empirical studies, she classifies high sensitivity as an innate temperament trait—characterized by deeper cognitive processing, higher emotional reactivity, and heightened sensory input. Her research builds on Carl Jung’s typology and integrates findings from neuroscience and evolutionary psychology, showing that high sensitivity evolved as a survival strategy in both humans and animals.
