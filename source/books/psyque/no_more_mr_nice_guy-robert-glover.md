## 🖋️ Overview

*No More Mr. Nice Guy* is a bold and direct self-help guide that targets the "Nice Guy Syndrome" — a pattern of passive, people-pleasing behavior that leads to frustration, resentment, and unfulfilling relationships. Dr. Robert Glover unpacks how these behaviors are rooted in childhood emotional conditioning and offers a clear path for men to reclaim their confidence, assertiveness, and authentic masculinity.

This book is not about becoming rude or aggressive; it’s about becoming honest, self-respecting, and emotionally mature.

## 🔬 Main Science (Relation with Psychological Theories)

Glover’s framework draws from developmental psychology, attachment theory, and family systems therapy. He explores how dysfunctional family dynamics and covert contracts shape men into Nice Guys who suppress their needs, seek external validation, and avoid conflict at all costs. The book blends cognitive-behavioral techniques and Jungian integration of the “shadow self” — encouraging readers to embrace their full emotional range, including assertiveness, anger, and desire.

- **Challenge Covert Contracts:** Identify the hidden agreements that create resentment and disappointment in your relationships.
- **Embrace Healthy Masculinity:** Reconnect with assertiveness, independence, and integrity — not aggression or control.
