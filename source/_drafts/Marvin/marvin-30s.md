# Marvin´s 30s

Marvin entered his thirties with a renewed sense of determination. The wild nights of booze and cigarettes became a memory he was happy to leave behind. He put together a clean résumé and managed to land a stable office job that paid decently and offered room for growth. It wasn’t exactly a dream position, but it came with something he hadn’t really felt in a long time: security.

Before long, he found a comfortable routine: early-morning coffee, the rush-hour commute, steady tasks at work, and evenings spent catching up on the latest shows or reading a book in bed. His new girlfriend, Lucía, was supportive and pragmatic—exactly what Marvin thought he needed. Together, they made future plans, discussing the possibility of moving somewhere quieter or pooling their savings to buy a condominium. A small circle of co-workers turned into a reliable group of friends. Weekend outings involved casual brunches or picnics at the park, instead of all-night bar-hopping.  

The years went by smoothly. Promotions at work helped Marvin afford a decent car and a trip abroad once in a while. Holidays were shared with Lucía’s family and his own, everyone nudging him to “settle down,” to pop the question, or to consider taking the next big step—maybe a house in the suburbs, maybe children. Family and social expectations seemed to guide him along a neatly laid path. At times, Marvin reminded himself that this was good—wasn’t it?

On the morning of his thirty-ninth birthday, Marvin woke up early in his modest but cozy apartment. Lucía was already at work, and he found a neatly wrapped gift and a sweet, handwritten note on the kitchen table. He should have felt grateful or content. Instead, a strange unease gnawed at him. As he sipped his coffee, the familiar morning silence felt heavier than usual.

He thought back to the choices he had made in life—or the ones that had been made for him. Somehow, by following the advice and well-meaning pushes of those around him, he had settled into an existence that looked perfectly fine on the surface. But was it really his own? Did he ever deliberately choose this trajectory, or did he simply drift into it because it was the “right thing to do”?

That afternoon, with birthday messages filling his phone, he felt strangely disconnected. At dinner with Lucía and a few friends, he forced a smile through shared memories and polite laughter. Yet inside, a voice he hadn’t heard in years began questioning everything. Had he pursued his actual passions? Or were these simply the passions everyone else expected him to have?

In the weeks that followed, Marvin found it impossible to dismiss these questions. He worked the same hours, kept up the same hobbies, went through the same motions. But a shift had begun—a restlessness, a yearning for something he couldn’t quite define. Turning forty loomed just ahead like an invisible dividing line, making him wonder if he could—or should—change course.

And so, quietly but undeniably, Marvin’s midlife crisis took root. Inwardly, he knew he stood at a crossroads once again: follow the established path deeper, or take a risk on something he’d never fully explored. For the first time in years, the question was no longer “Is my life good enough?” but rather “Whose life am I really living?”
