# Marvin 43yo

Thought for a few seconds

At forty‑three, Marvin no longer measured the distance between where he was and where he thought he should be. He woke each dawn in a small apartment that smelled faintly of sandalwood and loose‑leaf tea, sat on his mat, and followed his breath in quiet meditation. His practice wasn’t dramatic—no contorted poses for social media, no timer ticking in the background—just an honest settling of mind and body. In those first minutes of stillness he felt a gentle certainty: whatever rose today, he could meet it.

When the sun angled through the blinds, he rolled up the mat and put on Coltrane or a Bach cello suite, letting the music loosen the last knots of sleep. While coffee brewed, he opened whichever classic he was rereading—sometimes *The Odyssey*, other mornings Montaigne’s essays, or a dog‑eared anthology of haiku. The words felt like steady companions rather than homework. They reminded him that centuries of people had grappled with longing, fear, and wonder—and had still found room for grace.

Marvin’s work remained the same office job he once found stifling, but the relationship had changed. He treated each task as a single note in a longer melody: answer an email, feel the keys beneath his fingers; walk to a meeting, notice the rhythm of his steps; listen to a colleague’s frustration, meet it with the spaciousness he cultivated on the mat. Some days were smooth, others bristled with deadlines and terse voices, yet both belonged to the same broad river of experience. He no longer labeled one “good” and the other “bad.” They were simply different currents.

Evenings brought variety—an outdoor yoga class in the park, a slow run along the riverside, or a gathering with friends who cared more about telling honest stories than comparing salaries. Sometimes he stayed home and cooked a simple meal, letting chopped onions sizzle while Nina Simone filled the kitchen. No part of the routine promised perfection, but every part felt real.

The ghosts of his childhood—rulers, “garrotazos,” and playground taunts—didn’t vanish; they sat in the back row of his mind like quiet spectators. Marvin had stopped trying to shove them out. When an old memory surfaced, he greeted it the way he’d greet a difficult yoga pose: acknowledge the tension, breathe into it, and release when ready.

On clear nights he’d step onto the balcony, warm mug in hand, and track the city lights blinking below. He didn’t tell himself grand stories about destiny anymore. Instead he felt an uncomplicated gratitude: for the pulse in his chest, for the music drifting up from a neighbor’s window, for the chance to stand here and witness it all.

Marvin hadn’t achieved fame or amassed fortune, yet he sensed a quiet wealth that lay beyond those measures—a fluency with life’s ebb and flow. He had made peace with the boy he once was, mourned and released the lives he might have lived, and accepted the unpolished beauty of the one unfolding beneath his feet. When tomorrow arrived, he planned to meet it exactly as he met today: with an open spine, a steady breath, and the humble curiosity to see what the next moment would bring.
