# Marvin 8 years old

Marvin was eight years old now, tall enough that his mother had to adjust the seat of his bicycle every few months. Despite these small physical milestones, there was little comfort in his daily life. At his new school, he and his classmates faced an ominous presence: Mr. Roldán. Everyone whispered about the teacher’s crooked left hand—underdeveloped and stiff from a mild form of palsy—which he called *la garra*. More chilling, however, was how Mr. Roldán used that hand to deliver the punishment he called *el garrotazo*.

Every morning, Marvin shuffled into class, shoulders hunched and eyes scanning for any sign that Mr. Roldán’s temper might erupt. The teacher’s voice boomed with contempt whenever a student forgot a homework assignment, mumbled an answer, or even talked out of turn. But the real terror struck when his rigid fingers curled into a makeshift club, ready to strike.  

Marvin had witnessed the dreaded *garrotazo* on his very first day. A friend of his, nervously stammering during a recitation, was suddenly cut off by a hollow thud—Mr. Roldán’s twisted hand connecting with the boy’s upper arm. Shocked silence seized the room. The classmate blinked back tears, but Mr. Roldán just sneered and raised his malformed hand again, daring anyone else to break his arbitrary rules.  

Soon enough, Marvin also felt the sting. His head buzzed with dread every time he stepped through the school’s doors. Any idle chatter, misplaced pencil, or uncertain glance could set Mr. Roldán off. Day after day, fear overtook the students. Some of them, like Marvin, struggled to sleep at night, reliving their teacher’s bitter scowl and braced for the next strike.  

In quieter moments, Marvin noticed his classmates had changed. They rarely laughed out loud, wary of attracting attention. Though only eight years old, they exchanged glances filled with the knowledge of a secret agony. Guilt, anger, and helplessness clouded their eyes. Marvin sometimes thought about the teacher who had terrorized him back when he was four. But this time, there were no makeshift traps or inventive plans in his head—just a gnawing fear that any sudden movement would bring another slap of *la garra*.  

A few times, Marvin caught his classmates whispering among themselves about telling someone—another teacher, a parent, or even the principal—but the threats Mr. Roldán hissed in their ears lingered more heavily in their minds: *If you complain, I’ll make your life worse than you can imagine.* Each child felt too small and too alone.  

So the year wore on in hushed tension. Curled shoulders and timid footsteps became the norm, while bruises—physical or otherwise—remained hidden away. Marvin waited for the day that someone would rescue them from the shadow of Mr. Roldán and his *garra*, but in the meantime, survival meant staying silent, trying his best not to draw attention, and hoping that maybe tomorrow would be different.
