# Marvin's 20s
 
Marvin was in his early twenties when he dropped out of college. It wasn’t a specific moment of decision so much as a gradual drift: missed classes, half-written papers, and a growing sense that it wasn’t leading him anywhere he wanted to go. Needing money, he took a job working nights at a local bar.

The bar’s neon lights and late-night chaos suited him at first. The tips from customers were surprisingly good, and the steady stream of music, laughter, and clinking glasses felt intoxicating—so much so that when his shift ended, Marvin often stayed, drinking whatever cocktails he and the other bartenders concocted for themselves. He convinced himself this was all part of the job, part of networking.  

Days bled into nights, and weekends became hazy marathons of pumping music and swirling colored lights. He tumbled through short-lived relationships, latching onto the intensity of new faces in the crowd. Everyone seemed to be in high spirits under the dim glow of the bar, and Marvin loved the way alcohol made it easier for strangers to become friends—at least for a night.

Long after midnight, he’d find himself jumping from after-parties to early-morning diners, finally dragging himself home just before sunrise. Sleep became a vague interval between shifts, and hangovers turned into a persistent dull headache he learned to ignore. Sometimes, Marvin wondered if this had become his default path: a life of loud music, stale cigarette smoke clinging to his clothes, and fleeting moments of excitement that evaporated when daylight hit.

By his late twenties, however, the shine began to fade. He noticed that the same faces cycled through the bar, always talking about big dreams they never chased. He saw some of his acquaintances vanish—going home to other states, burning out, or moving on. And he couldn’t shake a sense of emptiness, a nagging reminder that he was letting himself drift instead of directing his own life.

One morning, after clocking out and finishing a final round of drinks with friends, Marvin caught a glimpse of himself in the bar’s mirrored wall. His eyes were bloodshot, his reflection worn. Even in the dim light, he could see the toll that late nights and heavy partying had taken. That was when something shifted in him.  

As he approached his thirtieth birthday, Marvin realized this was not the future he had imagined for himself as a child. Dreams of something more—something meaningful—flickered again in his mind. He decided it was time to do something different, even if he wasn’t entirely sure what that was. He only knew the path he was on would lead him nowhere he truly wanted to be.
