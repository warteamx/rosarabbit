# 5 years old

Marvin was born in 1980, and in the autumn of 1984, a few days before his fifth birthday, he began his first year of school. At home, he was a gentle boy with an imagination bigger than his tiny body—constantly inventing games, drawing dragons and knights, or tinkering with little contraptions made of sticks, string, and glue.

His teacher, Ms. Lamala—an inexplicably stern old woman—soon became the source of nightly whispers and worried conversations in Marvin’s household. From the first day, there was something unsettling about her. She always wore a threadbare cardigan, clutched books with gnarled fingers, and snapped at children who spoke out of turn. But Marvin’s parents shrugged it off at first, hoping it was just a rumor that she disciplined students too harshly.

All illusions were shattered one cold, drizzly Wednesday when Marvin was late returning from lunch. Without warning, Ms. Lamala struck him several times with "cachetes" , "coscorrones" and "sopapos" on his shoulders head and face. Stunned by pain and fear he had never experienced before, Marvin’s eyes filled with tears, which only made the old woman cackle with thinly disguised amusement. Through blurred vision he caught sight of her gold tooth glinting in a grim half-smile. In that small, brutal moment, Marvin understood the teacher found an unnerving satisfaction in her cruelty.

That night, a vivid nightmare awoke Marvin from sleep. Ms. Lamala’s face loomed large, her grin stretching wider and her golden tooth flashing in the darkness. The dream planted an odd, persistent seed in his mind—an idea he couldn’t quite place. The next morning, while building a simple block tower in his bedroom, Marvin found himself thinking: If only I could set a trap to keep her away from me…

Day after day, as the physical punishment was almost daily, the notion of crafting traps to stop (and, in his wildest four-year-old daydreams, even “kill”) Ms. Lamala began to occupy more of his imagination than his beloved paper dragons. He wove string across his bedroom doorway, giggling at the thought of Ms. Lamala tripping. Sometimes he tried to hide sharp pencils in cardboard contraptions, uncertain how it would all come together, but proud of his inventive spirit. Each time he thought about “catching” her, he also felt a spark of guilt—yet the daydreams continued, driven by fear and anger he couldn’t quite voice in any other way.

Family and friends noticed Marvin’s strange behaviours and emotional outbursts. Marvin was learning trauma, depression, anxiety and helplessness. All Marvin’s classmates lived under the ever-present threat of Ms. Lamala’s punishment.

Summer arrived in 1985, bringing a sudden, if temporary, release. The school closed for vacation, and Marvin was free to roam in the sun, splash in backyard sprinklers, and lose himself in harmless daydreams about pirates and treasure hunts. He built twig houses in the yard and tried to forget the welts on his hands and arms. Gradually, the thought of “making traps” to harm his teacher faded like a bad dream. A child’s mind is resilient, and the warm sunshine, long days, and gentle evenings with his parents soothed away many of the anxieties that had wrapped themselves around his young heart.

When classes resumed in the fall of 1985, Marvin trudged back to school with knotted nerves. He paused in the hallway, glancing at the door to the classroom he had known before. He expected Ms. Lamala’s rigid frame and punishing stare, that ugly ruler lying ominously on the desk. Instead, he was greeted by a bright-faced woman, Ms. Vesper, who was gently helping a smaller child hang up his coat.

Ms. Vesper knelt down to Marvin’s eye level, smiling kindly. “Welcome to my class,” she said. She must have seen a shadow of worry in his expression because she spoke more softly. “We’re going to have a wonderful year together.”

And just like that, the months of nightmares and half-baked trap ideas dropped from Marvin’s shoulders. He felt something inside him loosen—like a knot untangling. Ms. Vesper’s voice and the sweetness in her eyes quickly replaced the echo of the old woman’s cackle. It seemed the terrible weight of a year’s obsession had finally lifted, and though Marvin would always remember Ms. Lamala’s gold tooth and shrill laughter, the fear no longer haunted him.

He would soon leave his stick-and-string traps behind and turn his bright imagination back to drawing, building, and dreaming of harmless wonders again—exactly how childhood ought to be. However, four years later, at age eight, he would find himself trapped again with another abusive teacher, this one with a unique punishment method: “El garrotazo”.
