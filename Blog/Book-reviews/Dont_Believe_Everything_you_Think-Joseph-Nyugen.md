## ✅ Practical Takeaways

- **You Are Not Your Thoughts**  
  Just because a thought appears in your mind doesn’t mean it’s true or worth believing.

- **Suffering Comes from Resistance**  
  We don’t suffer because of our experiences—we suffer because we resist what is happening through our thinking.

- **Inner Peace Is Always Available**  
  When you step out of the noise of your mind, what remains is clarity, peace, and presence.

- **Awareness Is the Key**  
  Begin to watch your thoughts like clouds passing in the sky. Don’t chase or argue with them—just notice.

- **The Present Moment Is All That Exists**  
  All anxiety and regret come from thinking about the past or future. The present is where peace lives.

- **Stop Trying to Be Happy—Just Stop Believing What Makes You Unhappy**  
  You don’t need to “think positively.” Instead, just stop giving power to thoughts that cause suffering.
